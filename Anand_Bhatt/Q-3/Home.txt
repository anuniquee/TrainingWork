 Located in the foothills of Mount Girnar, Junagadh is the seventh-largest city in
 Gujarat. The literal meaning of the term 'Junagadh' is an 'old fort' which derives 
 from Uparkot, an ancient fort built in the 4th century CE on a plateau in the 
 middle of the town, and is the major attraction of Junagadh tour packages. It was
 also termed as 'Yonagadh,' which means 'City of the Greeks,' as it was once ruled
 by the Greeks. Junagadh is also known as 'Sorath', the name of the princely state
 that existed before the partition of India and Pakistan in the year 1947.
