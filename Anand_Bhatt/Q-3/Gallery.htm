point in Gujarat. For centuries, Mount Girnar has been one of the most important 
pilgrimage sites in Gujarat and indeed in all of Western India, with 866 Hindu and 
Jain temples spread over its 5 summits. For Jains, this place is considered holy as 
this is the Nirvana Kshetra of 22nd Tirthankara Neminath and for Hindus, this place

starts from Girnar Talati, which is about 6 km from Junagadh Junction. While 
ascending the stone path that connects the temples along the 5 summits, one will
